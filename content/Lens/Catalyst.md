# ✒️ Catalyst

Catalyst is where the big questions live.

This lens explores ideas that shape how we see the world - from philosophy and first principles to timeless human struggles. These aren’t surface-level takes. This is where I pause to reflect, rethink, and rediscover meaning in work, life, and existence.

**Expect:** Deep dives into human nature, existential ponderings, value systems, and reflections on what truly matters.
