## 🛠️ What is Insight?

Insight is a space for those who seek clarity - <br> through new ideas, tools, and perspectives.

It’s where I share what I learn, what shifts my thinking, and what I believe is worth your time.

I’m here to contribute - to leave behind something meaningful. <br>
Because time is limited. Noise is endless.

This is the place where attention meets intention.
