# 👁️ Beyond Lens

**Beyond Lens** is a map of perspectives — the core lenses I use to explore, question, and document the world.

Each lens isn’t just a tag. It’s a way of thinking, a focused perspective that brings coherence to complexity. Everything I write here is filtered through one (or more) of these.

This space will grow. As new patterns and ideas emerge, more lenses will join — carefully chosen, never bloated.
