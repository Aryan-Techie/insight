Glad you’re here, <br> <br> I’m Aryan — though online, you might know me as **Aroice** or **Aryan Techie**.

I’m a Computer Science student at IIT Patna, but more than that - <br> I’m someone obsessed with the *why* behind things. <br><br>  Why we think the way we do. Why certain ideas resonate. How the right systems, tools, or words can change the trajectory of a day, a project, or a life.

### 🧠 What Drives Me

We live in a noisy world - endless content, constant pings, shallow distractions. My work is a response to that chaos.  <br> <br> 
Whether it's a line of code, a video, a journal entry, or a product — my goal is the same:

> **To craft things that quiet the noise, clarify the mind, and help people live with more intent.**

That’s what this blog — *Insight* — is about.  
It's not niche-driven. It’s clarity-driven. It's where I distill thoughts on:
- Systems thinking
- Philosophy
- Tech tools & workflows
- Mental models
- Deep dives from my own creative & coding journey
