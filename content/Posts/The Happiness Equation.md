## A Strange Realization at 2 AM üïë

I was lying in bed scrolling through LinkedIn (bad habit, I know) when I saw a post about someone my age landing their "dream job." Instead of feeling inspired, I felt... disappointed? Not in them, but in myself for not being "there" yet.

Just a few minutes earlier, I felt okay. Content, even. But then something shifted. Suddenly, I felt behind in a race I didn‚Äôt even know I was running.

That‚Äôs when it clicked: my happiness had just shifted based purely on comparison, not on any actual change in my circumstances. Same life, same progress, same everything but suddenly it felt inadequate because of what I saw on a screen.

This led me down a rabbit hole of thinking about expectations and how they secretly control our emotional lives in ways we rarely notice.

## The Math Behind This Misery

Here's something I learned from [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger), the 98-year-old billionaire:  
> "The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations, you're going to be miserable your whole life."

This sounds depressing until you realize he's sharing the formula:  
**Happiness = Reality - Expectations**

When reality beats your expectations, you feel great.  
When expectations beat reality, you feel terrible.  
The actual events matter less than this gap.

**Key Insights:**
- Your mood depends more on expectations than circumstances  
- We resist "low expectations" thinking it kills ambition  
- Most disappointment comes from mismatched mental pictures  
- The expectation side is often more controllable than the reality side  

## Why Our Brains Sabotage Us

There's this brutal quote:  
> "If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult."

We don't just want happiness we want to be *happier than others.*  
Social media makes this worse by showing us everyone's highlight reel while we're living our behind-the-scenes moments.

I noticed this pattern in my own thinking. Made some solid progress? Felt proud until I saw someone else raise funding, ship a new product, or land a prestigious role.  

It‚Äôs like our brains have this built-in comparison engine that can turn any good thing into a disappointment if the context is wrong.

## The Expectation Experiment I'm Trying

Instead of fighting this tendency, I've been experimenting with working alongside it:

**Daily Gratitude (But Specific)**  
I write down three things I normally take for granted. Not generic stuff like ‚Äúhealth‚Äù but specific things like ‚Äúmy laptop didn‚Äôt crash today‚Äù or ‚Äúgot an unexpected compliment from a friend.‚Äù

**The Reality Check Question**  
Before any event, I ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs actually likely to happen here?‚Äù Not best-case or worst-case, just realistic middle ground.

**Reverse Progress Tracking**  
Instead of focusing on gaps between where I am and want to be, I look at gaps between where I am now and where I was six months ago.

## What Actually Changed

The weird thing about expecting less is you often get more satisfaction from the same experiences. It‚Äôs like adjusting your phone‚Äôs brightness same screen, different perception.

I‚Äôm not talking about giving up goals or becoming pessimistic. I‚Äôm talking about approaching life with a bit more humility and a lot more appreciation for ordinary moments.

**Small Shifts That Worked:**
- Celebrating tiny wins instead of waiting for big ones  
- Planning for delays without being stressed about them  
- Finding interest in routine moments  
- Controlling my inputs (what I expose myself to) more carefully  

## A Simple Week-Long Challenge

Pay attention to your disappointments for just one week. When something bothers you, ask:  
**"Is this about what happened, or about what I expected to happen?"**

You might discover, like I did, that most frustration comes from the second category.

Also try this: pick one routine activity commuting, eating lunch, studying, whatever and go in with zero expectations. Just observe what happens when you‚Äôre not mentally scripting the experience.

## The Real Point

Managing expectations isn‚Äôt about being negative or settling for less. It‚Äôs about finding a sustainable way to be content while still growing.

The happiest people I know aren‚Äôt the ones with the most achievements.  
They‚Äôre the ones who‚Äôve figured out how to appreciate what they have while working toward what they want without letting the gap torture them.

You can control both sides of the happiness equation, but most of us only focus on changing reality.  
Sometimes the bigger impact comes from adjusting expectations and that part is entirely up to you.
