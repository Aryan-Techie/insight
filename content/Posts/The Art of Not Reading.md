## A Small Moment That Changed Everything ðŸ“š

Last Wednesday, I was reorganizing my bookshelf for a video call when something clicked. As I moved books around to look more "intellectual," I realized most of them had never been opened. Not just unfinished literally never cracked open.

It was one of those quiet moments where you suddenly see yourself clearly. I wasn't a reader who collected books. I was someone who collected the identity of being a reader.

## The â‚¹16,000 Wake-Up Call

Here's my slightly embarrassing confession: I tracked my book spending last year. â‚¹16,000 worth of knowledge sitting on shelves, while I actually finished reading just 8 books. That math hit different â‚¹2,000 per book I actually consumed (now I pirate ebooks, but that's a different kind of guilt).

I had to laugh at myself. I was literally paying premium prices for the *feeling* of being well-read.

**Key Realizations:**
- Buying books triggers the same dopamine as actually learning
- We often confuse intention with action
- Identity purchases rarely lead to identity changes
- The gap between who we want to be and who we are shows up in our bookshelves

## Why Our Brains Play Tricks on Us

Here's something fascinating I discovered: your brain can't really tell the difference between planning to learn something and actually learning it. When you buy that productivity book, your mind goes "Great! We're productive now!" even though nothing has changed.

It's like your brain thinks the hard work is done once you've made the purchase. The actual reading? That's just a minor detail for future you to handle.

I used to tell people I loved reading, and I genuinely believed it. But what I actually loved was the *idea* of being someone who reads. Much easier than the actual sitting down and turning pages part.

## The Overwhelm Trap

Standing in front of my bookshelf became this weird form of decision paralysis. Philosophy or fiction? Self-help or biography? Should I finish what I started or try something new?

With infinite options, I'd choose none and scroll my phone instead. At least Instagram doesn't require commitment.

**The Pattern I Noticed:**
- More choices often lead to fewer decisions
- Overwhelm is the enemy of action
- Simple systems beat complex collections

## My Experiment: 

After that â‚¹16,000 reality check, I decided to try something different. Not a rigid system or perfect plan just a playful experiment with some loose guidelines.

**What I Tried:**

*The 3-Month Buying Ban*

I went cold turkey on book purchases. This wasn't about punishment; it was about breaking the psychological link between wanting knowledge and buying books. Turns out, I already owned years worth of unread wisdom.

*The One-Book Rule*

I kept exactly one book by my bed. When I finished it, I could pick another from my existing collection. This eliminated choice paralysis and created natural momentum.

*Hand-Written Notes*

I started scribbling thoughts on actual paper while reading. Something about the physical act made ideas stick better than digital highlights ever did.

*Permission to Quit*

I learned about this interesting rule: take 100 minus your age, and that's how many pages you should give a book before deciding to quit. So at present I'm 18, I give books 82 pages (100-18=82). It's not a hard rule, but it feels fair enough time for the book to prove itself, but not so much that you're trapped with something boring.

If a book didn't grab me by then, I'd just put it back without the whole internal drama of "but I'm supposed to be disciplined" or "what if the good part is coming next?" Sometimes you just know when something isn't clicking, and that's perfectly fine.


## What I Actually Discovered

The most surprising thing? Once I stopped buying and started actually reading, books transformed from decoration into conversation partners. I'd reference ideas in real situations, connect concepts across different authors, and actually remember what I'd learned weeks later.

My bookshelf got smaller, but my thinking expanded.

Also, finishing a book creates a completely different satisfaction than buying one. When you close a book you've actually absorbed, you immediately know which friend would love it, which idea you want to test, or which concept challenges something you believed.

**Small Shifts That Made Big Differences:**
- Treating books as tools, not trophies
- Embracing imperfection over impressive collections
- Focusing on application rather than accumulation
- Building reading habits instead of reading displays

## A Simple Challenge (If you're up for it)

Right now, take a quick look around. Notice the unread books in your space. Don't count them, just observe the ratio of read to unread.

Pick one book that genuinely sparks your curiosity. Not the one that looks impressive or the one you think you *should* read. The one that makes you actually wonder what's inside.

Read 10 pages today before consuming any other content. Just 10 pages, maybe 15-20 minutes of your day.

Those 15 minutes represent choosing growth over entertainment, intention over impulse, your actual self over your imagined self.

## What This Taught Me About Learning

The books that really changed my thinking weren't the ones that made me look smart on video calls. They were the ones that made me uncomfortable, that argued with my existing beliefs, that forced me to reconsider things I thought I knew.

Your dusty bookshelf isn't a failure, it's data. It shows you the beautiful, human gap between intention and action. That gap isn't something to shame yourself about; it's something to work with.

**The Core Lesson:**
Sometimes the most powerful insights come from paying attention to our own patterns and approaching change with curiosity instead of criticism.

The goal isn't to become someone who owns impressive books. The goal is to become someone who thinks differently because of what they've actually read.

Start with one. 
Start today.
For sure your future self is quietly cheering you on.
