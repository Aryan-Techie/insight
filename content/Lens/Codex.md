# ðŸ’» Codex

Codex is my digital lab.

This is where I write about code, tools, and tech â€” not just how things work, but how I *use* them. Itâ€™s where utility meets curiosity. From tiny scripts to entire systems, Codex holds the pieces that make my creative and technical workflow hum.

**Expect:** Notes on programming, setups, automations, tools I build or explore, and digital infrastructure that powers my work.
