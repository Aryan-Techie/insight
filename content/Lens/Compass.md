Compass is how I move through the world with intention.

Itâ€™s about building systems, workflows, and routines that support a deliberate, distraction-free life. Less theory, more action â€” but still thoughtful. Whether it's managing time, shaping habits, or optimizing digital flows, this lens orients me.
