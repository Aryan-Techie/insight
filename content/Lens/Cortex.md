# ðŸ§  Cortex

Cortex is a toolkit for thinking better.

Itâ€™s about clarity â€” the mental models, heuristics, and questions I rely on to make sense of complexity. These arenâ€™t just intellectual toys, but practical tools Iâ€™ve tested or found useful in real decisions.

**Expect:** Essays on decision-making, thought frameworks, cognitive tools, and notes on how to think sharper in a noisy world.
